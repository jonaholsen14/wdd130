            Hello I am Jonah Ries Olsen. I am a cyber security major but also one day hope to get into the film industry. I enjoy writing and animation as well as a lot of random hobbies such as penspinning and writing languages. I am not married but I do have two brothers one who will be starting school here next year. My dad was actually a Web designer before he became a data scientist. He says that web design helped him get into the tech industry. And that is the same reason why I took this class. Although learning more Ive found that web design is also a nice mix of creativity and technical programming skills which I enjoy. I've also always wanted to make a website called jonaholsen.com with a list of all the strange hobbies that I've learned. So I hope to do that in this class.
